# Get next line.
Hi! Hope you are doing great! 
This is my Get next line project from my common core journey, as a cadet, at 42 RIO.

The main proposal of this project is to develop a function that, when it's called, returns the next line of a text file. So, when you call it 2 times, it will return the first 2 lines, and so on. 

To develop the function I needed to study and understand what is "Static variables", "open(), read() and close()" functions, and how to use them. Also needed to study and understand how to deal with memory allocation and, the most important thing, how to deal with memory leaks.

Every line of code was made using C language.
